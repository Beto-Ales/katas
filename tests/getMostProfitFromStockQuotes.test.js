// Return the most profit from stock quotes.

// â€‚Stock quotes are stored in an array in order of date.
// The stock profit is the difference in prices in buying and selling stock.
// Each day, you can either buy one unit of stock, sell any number of stock units you have already bought, or do nothing.
// Therefore, the most profit is the maximum difference of all pairs in a sequence of stock prices.

// @param {array} quotes
// @return {number} max profit

// Example:

//  [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]        => 15  (buy at 1,2,3,4,5 and then sell all at 6)
//  [ 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]        => 0   (nothing to buy for profit)
//  [ 1, 6, 5, 10, 8, 7 ]       => 18  (buy at 1,6,5 and sell all at 10)
//  [ 1, 2, 10, 3, 2, 7, 3, 2 ] => 26  (buy at 1,2 and sell them at 10. Then buy at 3,2 and sell them at 7)
